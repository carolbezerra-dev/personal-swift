I have a repository called [trybe-projects-front-end](https://github.com/carolbezerra-dev/trybe-projects-front-end) where I put the projects when I was learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and React to become Front-end Developer.

Now, I want to migrate to iOS Developer, so here I am adapting these projects to Mobile format. I am learning Swift, so the goal is to remake the projects in SwiftUI and ViewCode versions.
