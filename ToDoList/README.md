## What I practiced with this project:

- Add image as background
- Add custom font and color
- Manipulate TextField
- Manipulate Buttons
- Manipulate Gestures (tap, double-tap and swipe)
- Work with List
- Add, delete one and delete all items
- Persist data with Core Data

### Device used during development: iPhone 14 Pro by Xcode Simulator

## The app must have:

### 1 - a title

- put a overline
- `"My To Do List"`
- font `Dancing Script`
- `size 30`

### 2 - an instruction

- `"Double-tap in a completed item"`
- font `Dancing Script`
- size `16`
- color `darksalmon`

### 3 - an text field to add item in the list

- color `darkviolet`
- border width `2` 
- corner `radius`

### 4 - a button, when tapping:

- a new item must be created at the end of the list
- text field must be cleared

### 5 - a button to delete all items from the list

- all items are replaced with a blank line

### 6 - when tapping on an item of the list:

- change the background color to `rgb gray (128,128,128)`
- only one task can be selected by once

### 7 - when long press on an item in the list:

- it should be `strikethrough (crossed out)`, indicating that it has been completed
- more than one task can be completed at same time

### 8 - delete one item:

- when swiping to left, it should delete this specific item from the list

### 9 - if you close and reopen the app, the list should continue as it was
