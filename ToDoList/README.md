## What I practiced with this project:

- Manipulate TextField
- Manipulate Buttons
- Manipulate Gestures (tap, double-tap and swipe)
- Work with List
- Add, delete one and delete all items
- Persist data with Core Data

### Device used during development: iPhone 14 Pro by Xcode Simulator

## The app must have:

### 1 - a title

- "My To Do List"

### 2 - an instruction

- phrase: "Click 2x in an completed item"

### 3 - an text field to add item in the list

### 4 - a button, when tapping:

- a new item must be created at the end of the list
- text field must be cleared

### 5 - a button to delete all items from the list

### 6 - when tapping on an item in the list:

- change the background color to rgb gray (128,128,128)
- undo this action by tapping the item again

### 7 - when double-tapping on an item in the list:

- it should be strikethrough (crossed out), indicating that it has been completed
- undo this action by double-tapping the item again

### 8 - when swiping to left:

- it should delete the specific item

### 9 - if you close and reopen the app, the list should continue as it was
